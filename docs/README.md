# Core Papers: Diversity-Preserving Horizontal Federated Reinforcement Learning for Chess

## **üéØ Your Research Focus**
**Training multiple instances of the same chess engine architecture with different playing styles (aggressive, positional, tactical), then using clustered federated learning to preserve beneficial diversity while enabling collaborative learning.**

### **Key Innovation:** 
Instead of homogenizing all models through traditional federated averaging, you cluster by style and preserve specializations while sharing universal chess knowledge.
