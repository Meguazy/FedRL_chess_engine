# 📚 Literature Review Folder Structure Explained

## **🎯 Research Goal:**
**Training multiple chess engines with different playing styles (aggressive, positional, tactical) using clustered federated learning to preserve beneficial diversity while enabling collaborative learning.**

---

## **📁 01_Foundational_FL_Theory/**
### **What it means:**
Basic principles of federated learning - how multiple devices can train together without sharing raw data.

### **Connection to this research:**
- **Essential foundation** - Understanding standard federated learning before improving it
- **Problem identification** - These papers show why traditional FedAvg fails with diverse data (homogenizes chess styles)
- **Baseline comparison** - The clustered approach will be compared against these standard methods

### **Key insight:**
Traditional FL would turn aggressive/positional/tactical engines into bland, generic chess players. This is what the research aims to prevent.

---

## **📁 02_Personalized_Clustered_FL/**
### **What it means:**
Advanced FL techniques that preserve individual characteristics while enabling collaboration.

### **Connection to this research:**
- **Direct solution to the problem** - These are the techniques that can preserve chess playing styles
- **Clustering strategies** - How to group similar chess engines without losing their unique characteristics
- **Diversity preservation** - Mathematical frameworks for maintaining beneficial differences

### **Key insight:**
This is the **core research area**. Papers like "Harmony in Diversity" literally describe the research goal.

Federated learning applied specifically to reinforcement learning, where agents have the same task (chess) but different approaches/environments.

### **Connection to this research:**
- **Same environment, different strategies** - Exactly the scenario (same chess rules, different playing styles)
- **FRL-EH framework** - The theoretical foundation that proves this approach can work
- **Proven convergence** - Mathematical guarantees that diverse chess engines will learn effectively

### **Key insight:**
**This is the theoretical backbone.** FRL-EH framework specifically handles "statistical heterogeneity" - which is exactly what different chess styles represent.
