# 📚 Literature Review Folder Structure Explained

## **🎯 Your Research Goal Reminder:**
**Training multiple chess engines with different playing styles (aggressive, positional, tactical) using clustered federated learning to preserve beneficial diversity while enabling collaborative learning.**

---

## **📁 01_Foundational_FL_Theory/**
### **What it means:**
Basic principles of federated learning - how multiple devices can train together without sharing raw data.

### **Connection to your research:**
- **Essential foundation** - You need to understand standard federated learning before improving it
- **Problem identification** - These papers show why traditional FedAvg fails with diverse data (homogenizes your chess styles)
- **Baseline comparison** - Your clustered approach will be compared against these standard methods

### **Key insight for you:**
Traditional FL would turn your aggressive/positional/tactical engines into bland, generic chess players. This is what you're trying to prevent.

---

## **📁 02_Personalized_Clustered_FL/**
### **What it means:**
Advanced FL techniques that preserve individual characteristics while enabling collaboration.

### **Connection to your research:**
- **Direct solution to your problem** - These are the techniques that can preserve chess playing styles
- **Clustering strategies** - How to group similar chess engines without losing their unique characteristics
- **Diversity preservation** - Mathematical frameworks for maintaining beneficial differences

### **Key insight for you:**
This is your **core research area**. Papers like "Harmony in Diversity" literally describe your research goal.
