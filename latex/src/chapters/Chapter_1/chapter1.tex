\section{Research Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:background}

The convergence of federated learning, reinforcement learning, and educational robotics presents unprecedented opportunities for developing intelligent systems that preserve beneficial diversity while enabling tangible human interaction. The advent of federated learning has revolutionized distributed machine learning by enabling collaborative model training without centralized data sharing \cite{mcmahan2017fedavg}, while reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success in complex strategic domains, most notably demonstrated by AlphaZero's mastery of chess, shogi, and Go through self-play \cite{silver2017mastering}. Simultaneously, advances in educational robotics have created new possibilities for human-AI interaction that transform abstract computational concepts into concrete, experiential learning opportunities.

In the domain of chess artificial intelligence, the homogenization of playing styles represents a fundamental challenge that extends beyond computational efficiency to impact human learning and engagement. Traditional federated learning approaches, particularly Federated Averaging (FedAvg) \cite{mcmahan2017fedavg}, inherently drive participating models toward convergence, effectively eliminating the beneficial diversity that characterizes human chess expertise. This convergence tendency directly contradicts centuries of chess theory, which recognizes the existence of diverse playing styles such as tactical, positional, aggressive, and dynamic approaches, each offering unique strategic advantages in different game contexts \cite{matanovic1974encyclopedia}.

The motivation for this research stems from three critical observations that reveal significant gaps in current federated learning applications:

\textbf{Loss of Strategic Diversity in AI Systems:} Recent empirical analysis has demonstrated that chess players naturally cluster by playing style preferences, with opening repertoire choices serving as reliable indicators of strategic inclinations \cite{demarzo2022quantifying}. This natural clustering suggests that beneficial heterogeneity exists in chess expertise and should be preserved rather than eliminated through homogenizing aggregation methods. However, no existing federated learning framework specifically addresses the preservation of such strategic diversity while maintaining collaborative learning benefits.

\textbf{Disconnect Between AI Capabilities and Human Learning:} While modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance, they often provide generic, homogenized playing experiences that fail to offer the varied learning opportunities that human players need for skill development. Human chess improvement relies on exposure to different playing styles and strategic approaches, yet current AI systems increasingly converge toward similar patterns that, while optimal, provide limited educational value for human learners seeking to understand chess diversity.

\textbf{Lack of Physical Validation for Federated Learning Diversity:} Existing federated learning research predominantly focuses on computational metrics and algorithmic performance, with limited attention to whether preserved diversity translates into genuinely different and valuable user experiences. The field lacks comprehensive physical validation systems that can demonstrate whether theoretical diversity preservation creates meaningful real-world differences that humans can recognize, learn from, and benefit from in practical applications.

These observations led to the realization that chess represents an ideal domain for developing diversity-preserving federated learning approaches, with the additional opportunity to validate these approaches through physical robotic systems that enable direct human interaction. The computational advantages of federated learning become particularly compelling when applied to chess engine development, where training state-of-the-art models requires substantial computational resources typically available only to major technology companies. By enabling distributed training across multiple nodes while preserving the strategic diversity that makes chess intellectually rich, and by validating this diversity through physical robotic demonstration, federated chess learning could democratize access to advanced chess AI development while providing tangible proof of the educational value of preserved diversity.

Furthermore, the integration of physical chess-playing robotics addresses a critical gap in human-AI interaction research. While significant advances have been made in developing chess AI systems and in building robotic manipulation systems, few attempts have been made to create comprehensive systems that bridge high-level strategic AI decision-making with precise physical execution, particularly in educational contexts where style diversity is crucial for effective learning.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}

Standard federated learning protocols, exemplified by Federated Averaging (FedAvg), employ homogenizing aggregation strategies that systematically eliminate client heterogeneity in pursuit of global model convergence \cite{li2020federated}. When applied to chess reinforcement learning and deployed in physical robotic systems designed for human interaction, this homogenization process creates multiple interconnected problems that span computational efficiency, educational effectiveness, and human-robot interaction quality.

Specifically, the application of traditional federated learning to distributed chess engine training and physical robotic deployment exhibits the following critical limitations:

\textbf{Strategic Homogenization in Distributed Training:} Traditional federated aggregation forces diverse chess engines toward a uniform playing style that represents a statistical average of all participants, eliminating the tactical aggressiveness, positional depth, and dynamic flexibility that characterize distinct chess approaches. This homogenization not only reduces the computational diversity that could benefit distributed learning but also creates generic AI personalities that provide limited educational value when deployed in interactive systems.

\textbf{Loss of Adaptive Capability in Physical Deployment:} Homogenized models lose the ability to adapt their playing style to different opponents or game situations, a capability that human chess masters employ to optimize their chances of success against varied competition. When deployed in physical robotic systems designed for human interaction, this limitation becomes particularly problematic as human learners benefit from exposure to varied strategic approaches rather than encountering the same generic playing pattern regardless of the selected opponent or learning context.

\textbf{Reduced Learning Efficiency in Collaborative Training:} By forcing convergence toward a single strategic approach, traditional federated learning fails to leverage the complementary knowledge that different playing styles contribute to overall chess understanding. This inefficiency is compounded when the trained models are deployed in educational robotic systems, as the lack of strategic diversity limits the range of learning experiences that can be provided to human users.

\textbf{Inadequate Physical Validation of Diversity Preservation:} Current federated learning research lacks comprehensive methods for validating whether theoretical diversity preservation translates into meaningful differences in real-world applications. The absence of physical validation systems means that claims about diversity preservation remain abstract and unverified, limiting confidence in the practical value of advanced federated learning approaches.

\textbf{Limited Human-Robot Interaction Design for Educational Applications:} Existing robotic chess systems focus primarily on mechanical execution rather than leveraging AI diversity for educational purposes. The lack of integration between advanced federated learning approaches and educational robotics represents a significant missed opportunity for creating more effective human-AI learning environments.

\textbf{Theoretical Inconsistency with Domain Expertise:} The homogenization approach contradicts established chess theoretical frameworks maintained by grandmaster authorities, which recognize tactical, positional, and dynamic approaches as equally valid but strategically distinct paradigms \cite{matanovic1974encyclopedia,chess_opening_styles}. This inconsistency becomes particularly problematic when developing educational systems intended to teach chess concepts that depend on understanding strategic diversity.

The central research problem addressed in this thesis is: \textit{How can federated learning be adapted to preserve beneficial strategic diversity in chess reinforcement learning while enabling collaborative knowledge transfer across distributed training nodes, and how can this diversity be validated and utilized through physical robotic systems that provide meaningful educational experiences for human learners?}

This problem requires developing novel aggregation mechanisms that maintain the distinct strategic identities of different chess playing styles while facilitating the sharing of universal chess knowledge such as tactical motifs, endgame principles, and fundamental strategic concepts. Additionally, it requires creating comprehensive physical validation systems that demonstrate the practical value of preserved diversity through tangible human-robot interaction experiences that prove the educational and engagement benefits of maintaining strategic heterogeneity in federated learning systems.
