\section{Research Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:background}

The advent of federated learning has revolutionized distributed machine learning by enabling collaborative model training without centralized data sharing \cite{mcmahan2017fedavg}. Simultaneously, reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success in complex strategic domains, most notably demonstrated by AlphaZero's mastery of chess, shogi, and Go through self-play \cite{silver2017mastering}. The intersection of these paradigms, federated reinforcement learning, presents unprecedented opportunities for developing distributed intelligent systems that can leverage collective experience while maintaining privacy and computational efficiency.

In the domain of chess artificial intelligence, the homogenization of playing styles represents a fundamental challenge that has received limited attention in current research. Traditional federated learning approaches, particularly Federated Averaging (FedAvg) \cite{mcmahan2017fedavg}, inherently drive participating models toward convergence, effectively eliminating the beneficial diversity that characterizes human chess expertise. This convergence tendency directly contradicts centuries of chess theory, which recognizes the existence of diverse playing styles such as tactical, positional, aggressive and dynamic approaches, each offering unique strategic advantages in different game contexts \cite{matanovic1974encyclopedia}.

Recent empirical analysis has demonstrated that chess players naturally cluster by playing style preferences, with opening repertoire choices serving as reliable indicators of strategic inclinations \cite{demarzo2022quantifying}. This natural clustering suggests that beneficial heterogeneity exists in chess expertise and should be preserved rather than eliminated through homogenizing aggregation methods. The preservation of such diversity is not merely an academic curiosity but represents a fundamental requirement for developing chess AI systems that can adapt to varied opponents and game contexts.

The computational advantages of federated learning become particularly compelling when applied to chess engine development, where training state-of-the-art models requires substantial computational resources typically available only to major technology companies. By enabling distributed training across multiple nodes while preserving the strategic diversity that makes chess intellectually rich, federated chess learning could democratize access to advanced chess AI development while maintaining the game's inherent complexity and appeal.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}

Standard federated learning protocols, exemplified by Federated Averaging (FedAvg), employ homogenizing aggregation strategies that systematically eliminate client heterogeneity in pursuit of global model convergence \cite{li2020federated}. When applied to chess reinforcement learning, this homogenization process destroys the beneficial diversity of playing styles that has been recognized as fundamental to chess mastery for centuries.

Specifically, the application of FedAvg to distributed chess engine training exhibits the following critical limitations:

\textbf{Strategic Homogenization:} Traditional federated aggregation forces diverse chess engines toward a uniform playing style that represents a statistical average of all participants, eliminating the tactical aggressiveness, positional depth, and dynamic flexibility that characterize distinct chess approaches.

\textbf{Loss of Adaptive Capability:} Homogenized models lose the ability to adapt their playing style to different opponents or game situations, a capability that human chess masters employ to optimize their chances of success against varied competition.

\textbf{Reduced Learning Efficiency:} By forcing convergence toward a single strategic approach, traditional federated learning fails to leverage the complementary knowledge that different playing styles contribute to overall chess understanding.

\textbf{Theoretical Inconsistency:} The homogenization approach contradicts established chess theoretical frameworks maintained by grandmaster authorities, which recognize tactical, positional, and dynamic approaches as equally valid but strategically distinct paradigms \cite{matanovic1974encyclopedia,chess_opening_styles}.

The central research problem addressed in this thesis is: \textit{How can federated learning be adapted to preserve beneficial strategic diversity in chess reinforcement learning while still enabling collaborative knowledge transfer across distributed training nodes?}

This problem requires developing novel aggregation mechanisms that maintain the distinct strategic identities of different chess playing styles while facilitating the sharing of universal chess knowledge such as tactical motifs, endgame principles, and fundamental strategic concepts.

\section{Research Objectives and Questions}
\label{sec:objectives}

\subsection{Primary Research Questions}
\label{subsec:primary-questions}

This research addresses four primary questions that collectively examine the feasibility and effectiveness of diversity-preserving federated learning in chess:

\textbf{RQ1: Style Preservation Feasibility}
Can federated learning architectures be designed to preserve distinct chess playing styles while enabling collaborative learning across distributed nodes?

\textbf{RQ2: Knowledge Transfer Optimization}
What is the optimal balance between style-specific knowledge preservation and universal chess knowledge sharing in a federated learning context?

\textbf{RQ3: Performance vs. Diversity Trade-offs}
How do diversity-preserving federated chess engines perform compared to traditional homogenized federated models and individual engines trained in isolation?

\textbf{RQ4: Clustering Strategy Effectiveness}
Which clustering strategies most effectively group chess engines by playing style while maintaining intra-cluster learning benefits and inter-cluster knowledge transfer opportunities?

\subsection{Secondary Research Questions}
\label{subsec:secondary-questions}

Supporting the primary research objectives, several secondary questions explore specific aspects of the proposed approach:

\textbf{SQ1: Style Quantification Methods}
How can chess playing styles be quantitatively measured and validated using both computational metrics and chess theoretical frameworks?

\textbf{SQ2: Communication Efficiency}
What are the communication overhead implications of clustered federated learning compared to standard federated approaches in chess training contexts?

\textbf{SQ3: Scalability Considerations}
How does the proposed diversity-preserving approach scale with increasing numbers of participating nodes and playing style categories?

\textbf{SQ4: Generalization Beyond Chess}
To what extent can the diversity-preserving federated learning principles identified in chess be generalized to other strategic domains with inherent style diversity?

\textbf{SQ5: Human-AI Style Similarity}
How closely do the preserved chess playing styles in federated engines correspond to recognized human playing style categories?
